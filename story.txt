Tony was only a couple of feets away from his parents' hut collecting apples,
but the jungle beside the hut had caught his eye for a really long time. There
was no doubt that the jungle was dangerous. However, as a baby, Tony's parents
had taken him on a hiking trip over mountains and deserts. Now that his family
had settled down in the tropical rainforest, Tony had came up plans to sneak 
out for adventures.

Tony tried sneaking out in the middle of the night to find wild tigers. He 
found a den of tigers sleeping and decided to sneak up on them. When he got
close, the tigers woke up and started roaring. Tony ran so fast that he
tripped and fell. He was knocked out and eaten in his sleep.

All of a sudden, Tony woke up. "Jimminy Crickets!" Tony said. He was back at the
tiger den. He could see into the future! Woah! This time Tony went in guns blazing.
He fricking killed every single tiger on the face of the earth. But in a turn of
events, brother bear style, Tony turned into a tiger. He was also very hungry.
What would Tony the Tiger eat?
